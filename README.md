# dastore
dastore is a library on [Pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/dastore)
I want to implement this library after fully considering user preferences regarding api complexity in an application.\
In contrast to [nomisal_res](https://pub.dev/packages/nomisal_res), it's a library much more practical.
In contrast to [dapresent](https://pub.dev/packages/dapresent), it's mainly about backend, not about the frontend.
